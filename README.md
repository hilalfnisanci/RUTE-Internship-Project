<h2 align="center">SUMMER INTERNSHIP PROJECT</h2>
<h5>This project is related to rail transport technologies. I developed this project during my summer internship at TÃ¼bitak RUTE. In this project, I created both the frontend and the backend part with Python.</h5>

<h5>In this project, the interface of the machinist screen in a train system has been developed. At the same time, I have developed the interface of the machinist control table, where there are physical switches for control.  I tried to make the designs of the screens by studying the documentation given to me.</h5>
